## Getting Started

### Installing development dependencies

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2. Run `brew bundle`

Learn more about [Swish](https://www.github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish) and [Xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)

### Renaming

There are some scripts to help rename base to whatever project name you want.

- Clone the templated repository
- run `./rename.sh`
- Enter a project name

## Continuing onward

### Regenerate the project

    swish xcodeproj

### Pushing to the App Store

This script expects `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLOADER_USERNAME` and `APPLOADER_PASSWORD` to be present in the environment.

It doesn't have to stay that way. Modify `Swish/Sources/appstore/Secrets.swift` to use an API key, or perhaps fetch credentials from a password manager like 1Password using [Sh1Password](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh1Password).

When that's settled, you can run

    swish appstore
